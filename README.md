# ZKML Inference with RISC Zero ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•

## üß† Goal  
Build a zero-knowledge proof system using [RISC Zero](https://www.risczero.com/) zkVM technology to prove that a machine learning inference was executed correctly ‚Äî without revealing the input. The result is verified on-chain using blockchain smart contracts.


## üìÑ Description  

This project demonstrates end-to-end **verifiable AI inference** by combining:

### 1. AI Model Selection  
- A simple yet expressive **fully connected neural network** trained on the **MNIST** dataset (28x28 binary images).
- The model performs digit classification (`0‚Äì9`) from binarized pixel inputs.
- The trained model is quantized into `i32` fixed-point values for compatibility with zkVM execution.

### 2. Verifiable Inference (Zero-Knowledge)  
- The model inference is executed inside the **RISC Zero zkVM guest environment**.
- A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is generated to cryptographically verify the model was run correctly, with given inputs and model weights, without revealing them.
- The guest program computes:
  - Layer 1: Dense + ReLU
  - Layer 2: Dense + Argmax

### 3. Blockchain Integration  
- A **smart contract** deployed on-chain (e.g., Ethereum-compatible).
- The smart contract acts as a **verifier** for proofs generated by RISC Zero.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies  
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch for training, binarized MNIST model (784 ‚Üí 64 ‚Üí 10).
- **Proof Generation**: RISC Zero zkVM + guest/host architecture.
- **Zero-Knowledge**: STARK-based proving system (via RISC Zero).
- **Blockchain**: Currently designed for Ethereum/Solana-compatible verifiers.
