# ZKVM risc0 ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•

## Goal  
A zero-knowledge proof system using RISC 0 technology with neural network model to generate proofs that machine learning inference was performed correctly. The Ethereum blockchain is used as a verifier.

## Description  

1. **AI Model Selection**  
   - Choose a simple yet effective AI model (e.g., a neural network for image classification).
   - Analyze the computational complexity of inference.  

2. **Verifiable Computing**  
   - Use the **RISC 0** to generate zero-knowledge proofs of correct model inference.

3. **Blockchain Integration**  
   - Implement a **smart contract** on a Ethereum blockchain platform.  
   - Verify the generated proof of correctness.  
   - Optionally, store the verified result and associated proof on the blockchain for auditing.
     
## Technologies  
- **ML Model**: Neural network in Guest code
- **Verifiable Computing**: zkVM, Risc0
